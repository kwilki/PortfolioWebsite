        <br>
        <p>I’m a student software engineer based in Melbourne with a background in Communication Design and interest in simplicity and user experience.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="subheading">Why simplicity?</p>
        <br>
        <p>I believe often the most simple solutions are the most elegant, allowing your design to be beautiful and professional while not distracting from the information you want to communicate with your audience.</p>

        <button class="accordion"><img id="icon" src="./Images/coffee-bean.png">Coffee!</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>I've been working in the coffee world for the last 7 years learning all there is to perfecting a morning cup o' Joe.</p>
                <p>Moving from Ballarat,  Melbournes infamous coffee scene initially had me intrigued and I was able to learn and meet a whole lot along the way.</p>
                <p>In 2018 I was fortunate enough to meet my then coffee supplier who took me to Colombia with him on his startup venture to connect producers with consumers, reducing costs for all and putting more money back in the hard working and often underappreciated hands of the farmers. The primary purpose of the trip was to make friends and enable the sharing of information, and for me - experiencing coffee from a much different perspective.</p>
                <p>Working with this startup is what got me reinvigorated to practice my rusty design skills and learn to code.</p>
                <p>Travel back to Colombia has me hooked and would love to pursue this in a post lockdown life.</p>

        <button class="accordion"><img id="icon" src="./Images/pencil-icon.png">Design</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>In 2014 I studied Communication Design at Monash University for 4 years.</p>
                <p>I loved the converstations it inspired, and still do, the whys of colour and placement and the randomeness or often flukes achieved through experimentation.</p>
                <p>Although im not practicing daily anymore I still love a gallery visit and would love to find time to start screenprinting again.</p>
